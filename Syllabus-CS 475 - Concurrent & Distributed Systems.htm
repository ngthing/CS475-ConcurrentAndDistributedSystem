    <p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b> </b>CS 367 (Computer Systems
        &amp; Programming)</span></p>
    <p class="p6"><span class="s1">This is a programming intensive
        course. You need to be comfortable with programming in C and
        Java to be able to do the programming assignments. It is also
        not a good idea to take this class if your course/work schedule
        is already quite full.</span></p>
    <span class="s1"><b><i>DESCRIPTION :</i>&nbsp;</b></span>
    <p class="p6"><span class="s1">The class focuses on issues that
        arise in the design and implementation of concurrent and
        distributed applications. Course work will involve several
        programming assignments.<br>
      </span></p>

    </ol>
    <span class="s1"><b><i>GRADING:</i></b></span>
    <p class="p6"><span class="s1">There will be four programming
        assignments (two dealing with concurrent programming and two
        with distributed/networked applications). The software required
        for these projects is available on the computers in the
        VS&amp;E&nbsp;Lab. You can also do the projects on your own
        computer. (The programming assignments involve programming in C
        or Java on a UNIX/Linux platform.)&nbsp; You can do the
        assignments individually or in a group of two students. There
        will be at least one "paper and pencil" assignment.<br>
      </span></p>
    <p class="p6"><span class="s1">50% of the course grade will be based
        on the assignments. In-class quizzes make up 15% of the overall
        course grade. Quizzes will not be announced in advance but you
        can expect a quiz once every two weeks or so. In addition, there
        will be a mid-term exam worth 15% of the grade. The final exam
        will account for the remaining 20% of the grade.<br>
      </span></p>
    <b><i>LATENESS:</i></b> <br>
    <p class="p6"><span class="s1"> The late submission policy for
        programming assignments is as follows: you have <b>4 slip days</b>
        that you can use during the course of the semester, but at most
        two slip days per assignment. An assignment is considered late
        by one day irrespective of whether you miss the deadline by 1
        minute or up to 24 hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> <b>Slip



            days only apply to programming assignments.</b><br>
