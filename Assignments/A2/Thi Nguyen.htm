    <h2>MY HISTORY</h2>
        <h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant <br><small>August, 2016 - Present</small></h3>
        <p>Since August 2016, I've worked as a UTA for <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department at George Mason University</a>.</p>
            <p>This semester, Fall 2017, I am a UTA for <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/media/syllabi/Fall2017/CS_306MaddoxT.html">CS 306 - Synthesis of Ethics and Law for the Computing Professional</a>.
            <br>CS 306 is, in fact, one of my favorite CS courses at Mason because the course teaches me to become an effective professional in the field of computer science by exposing me to many of the challenging legal and ethical issues surrounding computer technology and its use, and building a foundation for dealing with those challenges. I have learned about legal cases that deal with intellectual property in technology industry, as well as emerging legal and ethical issues involved in the computer profession and e-commerce.
            <br> 
            As a UTA for the course this semester, I use and enhance my knowledge that I have learned in this course to assist students in their homework and group project through answering student's questions and providing contructive feedback when grading their submissions. 
            </p><br>
            <p>In Spring 2017, I was a UTA for
            <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/media/syllabi/Spring2017/CS367AydinH.html" target="_blank">CS 367 - Computer Systems and Programming</a>.
            I assisted students in Piazza forum and office hours. My favorite project is the Binary Bomb! :) </p>
            <p>
            In Fall 2016, I was a UTA for
            <a href="http://catalog.gmu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=29&amp;poid=28260&amp;returnto=6270" target="_blank">Intro to Computer Programming (Python) and Object-Oriented Programming (Java)</a>.
            During this time, I answered students’ questions regarding Python and Java projects in lectures, labs, and office hours.
            I enjoyed helping the students, and I was happy to see the students (and myself) understanding the programming concepts better after I explain to them.
            </p>


        <h3>Summer Intern - Undergraduate Researcher <br><small>June - August, 2016</small></h3>
        <p>From June to August 2016, I participated in a <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1447489&amp;HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue">NSF funded Research Project</a> under supervision
            of Dr. Huzefa Rangwala at George Mason University.<br>
            During this time, I designed and developed a Web Application called DegreePlanner (see <a href="file:///Users/thinguyen/WebstormProjects/thisite/index.html#DegreePlanner" style="color:cornflowerblue">below</a>),
            which can read a student’s chosen degree, transcript
            data, show courses the student needs to take to complete his degree;
            It also allows the student to add courses to his planner. <br>
            Some of the technologies I used for this project are: Django Framework, Python, SQL, JQuery, AJAX.
        </p>

        <h3>Math &amp; Physics Tutor <br><small>January 2014 - May 2015</small></h3>
        <p>
            I was a <a href="file:///Users/thinguyen/WebstormProjects/thisite/MSC.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:cornflowerblue">Tutor</a> at the <a href="http://www.nvcc.edu/annandale/asc/math/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue">Math and Science Tutoring Center,
            Northern Virginia Community College at Annanale Campus</a>. <br>
            I was promoted to become lead tutor in December 2014. As a tutor, I'd assist 10 – 15 college students per day in improving their academic
            performance in general and enhanced their knowledge of Math and Physics through scaffolding explanation to their questions.
            <br>Providing constructive and effective feedback on the students’ studying and learning techniques was one of the tasks I'd tried to master.
            <br>As a lead tutor, I'd trained two new tutors and led five other tutors.
            Besides, I'd participated in developing guiding materials that enhance the Center’s services.
            <br>I co-authored the <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~tnguy138/BookofEverything072715" target="_blank" style="color: cornflowerblue">
            Book of Everything: A Training Manual and Workbook for Tutors and Lab Assistants</a>
            <br><b>Courses I have tutored:</b> Precalculus, Calculus I &amp; II, General University Physics I &amp; II
            <br><a href="file:///Users/thinguyen/WebstormProjects/thisite/images/MSC.pdf" target="_blank">My Certificate of Appreciation</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Book Seller &amp; Cashier <br><small>August 2012 - Dec 2013</small></h3>
        <p>
            Not many know that I learned a great deal of communication skills and customer services when I was working
            at the <a href="http://nvcc.bncollege.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/BNCBLocationAndContactView?catalogId=10001&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=24557" target="_blank">
            Barnes &amp; Nobles college bookstore at NOVA Annandale Campus</a>.
            I learned how to handle difficult customers, team work in rush hours, and
            observe customers' buying habits to restock supplies and products efficiently to increase
            sales performance.

                <br>
                MyTimeMaster started as a class project for the course

                    SWE432-Design &amp; Implementation of Software for the Web</a> in Fall 2016.
                This was a team project, so I started developing idea for this project with a partner.
                I led the project during semester and was responsible for coding Node.js backend and React frontend.
                My partner opted out after the class finished, and I've worked solely on the project since then.
                All the current designs and features of MTM you see now are developed by me during winter break 2016.<br>
                <strong style="color: cornflowerblue">Why MyTimeMaster? </strong><br>
                Good question! Before telling you all my drama stories
                (not that "drama") about this app, I would like to ask: When was the last time you call your Mom/ your Dad?
                When was the last time you spend time watching a favorite movie with your sister without worrying about
                homework or deadline? When was the last time you set a side sometime in your busy day just to be quite
                or to walk around your neighborhood to take in the beauty of life? (Am I going too far? haha...)<br>
                Anyway, hope you get my point!
                Those are some of the questions I often find myself contemplating during the "dynamic" and "busyness" of college life.
                I am sure not everyone feels the same as I do, but I am really afraid that I would miss my time with
                my loved ones and with myself if I just let life and time control me.<br>
                So I want to create a tool to access how I use time each day, each week, and each month.
                I want to know what percentage of my time is devoted to work, to study, to explore world, to my family, to my friends, etc.
                <br>With the current MTM, I can see these information within a day. ( weekly/monthly not yet supported)
                If my time allocation pie chart of a day is colorful, it means that I have a variety of activities in that day.
                Which is good! Because the last thing I want is that my day has only three activities: Work, eat, and sleep.
